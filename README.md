# alarm-clock

This is an alarm clock program written in Python by PiyushRaj714. It allows users to set an alarm for a specific time and date, and then plays a sound when the alarm goes off.

Getting Started
To run this program, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can download the alarm clock program from this GitHub repository. Simply clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Usage
To use the alarm clock program, simply run the alarm_clock.py file using Python from the command line. You can do this by navigating to the directory where the file is located and typing the following command:

Copy code
python alarm_clock.py
Once the program is running, you'll be prompted to enter the date and time you want the alarm to go off. You can do this by entering the year, month, day, hour, and minute in the format YYYY/MM/DD/HH/MM. For example, to set the alarm for May 10th, 2023 at 7:30 AM, you would enter the following:

yaml
Copy code
2023/05/10/07/30
After you've entered the date and time, the program will wait until the specified time and then play a sound to wake you up.

Customization
If you want to customize the alarm clock program, you can modify the alarm_clock.py file directly. For example, you can change the sound that plays when the alarm goes off by replacing the alarm.wav file with a different sound file.
